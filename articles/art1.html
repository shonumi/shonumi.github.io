				<p class="inner_text_large"><strong>Custom Graphics: Art History 102</strong></p>

				<p class="inner_text">Custom Graphics, or what this article will refer to as <strong>CGFX</strong>, are custom art assets that the user provides to an emulator. The emulator, in turn, replaces the game&#39;s native graphics with the ones from the user. Previously this type of enhancement was solely the domain of emulators for 3D consoles. On the N64 for example, people can replace the original textures of a game with high definition versions of their own. Project64 and Mupen64 allow this functionality. More recently, the Dolphin emulator has popularized custom textures for Gamecube and Wii games. However, for 2D, tile-based systems such as the SNES or Sega Genesis, there is currently nothing equivalent, and only for a few other systems has <strong>CGFX</strong> been attempted. This document will explain a new method that can be effectively used across many systems, from the NES, Game Boy and beyond.</p>

				<p class="inner_text">Before digging into that, it is important to understand why <strong>CGFX</strong> for 2D consoles has lagged, in both research and actual application. As this article later demonstrates, the task is simply non-trivial. It requires a lot of forethought when designing an emulator, a deep understanding of a console&#39;s graphics system, and even delves into some moderately fancy color math (e.g. blending, adjusting brightness, and calculating hues). Whereas replacing a texture on a 3D console may be straightforward from a programming point of view, 2D graphics pose an inherent challenge. Most 2D consoles store graphics in a tile-based format rather than a bitmap format. These tiles are often paletted as well. Without delving too much into specifics, tile formats simply add a lot more factors an emulator must consider compared to textures.</p>

				<p class="inner_text">Progress has been slow. Perhaps the first emulator to achieve <strong>CGFX</strong> was <a href="http://hisms.orgfree.com/">HiSMS</a>, a Sega Master System emulator by Botrops that specialized in replacing sprites and background tiles with HD versions. It allowed 8x8 pixel tiles to be replaced with 32x32 pixel tiles. Although there was only one release, it marked the first time something like that was done for emulators of 2D consoles. Unfortunately, HiSMS has long since been abandoned by the author. At the very least, however, it serves as a testament to the beginnings of <strong>CGFX</strong>. Things remained quiet for several years until another intrepid programmer Tim Foley aka tangent vector <a href="https://tangentvector.wordpress.com/2011/10/20/emulating-classic-2d-games-in-hd/">decided to try his hand at the Game Boy</a>. Through some trials, he was able to successfully create <a href="https://github.com/tangent-vector/gbhd">gbhd</a>. His work signaled yet another step towards getting functional <strong>CGFX</strong> for emulators. However, like HiSMS, gbhd never saw much further development</p>

				<p class="inner_text">Fast forward a couple of years, and the likes of <a href="https://github.com/mkwong98/HDNes">HDNES</a> by mkwong98 first appeared around 2013. Like other emulators of its calibur, it successfully replaced graphics, this time for the NES. HDNES is notable for being extensively developed and tested. A great deal of high definition graphics were made for the emulator. As a bonus, HDNES allows user to modify a game&#39s music as well. HDNES became one of the most prominent examples of <strong>CGFX</strong> in 2D console emulators as a result of how polished it was. Around this time as well, my fledging emulator known back then as GB Enhanced (GBE) also began supporting <strong>CGFX</strong> for Game Boy games. Eventually, its successor, GB Enhanced+ (GBE+) became the first emulator to apply <strong>CGFX</strong> to Game Boy Color games. At the time, my work was independent from gbhd (I had no idea Tim Foley had explored this area of emulation before until after I published an article about it back in 2013). What started off as an innocent suggestion from someone on the Dolphin emulator forums eventually evolved into something more. I will not make any grand claims on how GBE or GBE+ affected the course of <strong>CGFX</strong> in emulators, but I will say it laid the foundations of this theory and this article. Most of this work is based on the trials I overcame to get <strong>CGFX</strong> in working order. I&#39;ll let others decide how or if I managed to alter the history of emulation in any way.</p>

				<p class="inner_text">Having said all of this, the current state of <strong>CGFX</strong> is not looking well. HiSMS, gbhd, and even recently HDNES have all been inactive for some time. As far as it can be determined, GBE+ is the only emulator that is frequenctly updated. The work below will help others understand what I believe is a method that can universally allow <strong>CGFX</strong> in other emulators for 2D tile-based consoles, regardless of how different the actual systems are. In this way others can reasonably implement <strong>CGFX</strong> in their emulators if they choose to do so.</p>

				<p class="inner_text_large"><strong>Custom Graphics: The General Theory</strong>

				<p class="inner_text">The overall theory behind 2D Custom Graphics is relatively simple: <strong>for any 2D system that uses tile-based graphics, each of those tiles can be replaced with custom data within an emulator.</strong> While that much is easy enough to understand, the actual implementation to get from point A to B is much more complicated. There are many ideas that follow. Starting at the beginning, the target graphics for replacement must be identified in some way. After that, the user grabs a copy and edits this. Finally, the emulator loads the edited copy and displays it accordingly during gameplay. From these three stages, we can see that the first step is establishing a system that accurately identifies different tiles.</p>

				<p class="inner_text">The most direct way to determine the uniqueness of a set of data (graphics in this case) is to assign it an ID or number. This is the perfect solution for 2D tiles, however, these IDs must not be arbitrary. Rather, they must be consistently reproduceable given the same set of data. What the situation requires is a hash. A hash will represent a specific set of data, allowing the emulator to explicitly refer to one tile, but not others. The hash is essentially the result of an algorithm, using that set of data as input. Everytime that same set of data is entered into the algorithm, the algorithm should return the expected hash. In this way, the hash becomes a representation of that data set, and for <strong>CGFX</strong>, this means a hash refers to a specific tile that needs to be replaced.</p>

				<p class="inner_text">As a side note, normally the ideal algorithm will generate a specific hash for all possible amounts of input. So, no matter what the input data, the output hash would always be unique. When two sets of input data manage to produce the same hash from the algoritm, this is called a hash collision. With respect to <strong>CGFX</strong>, hash collisions are usually best avoided since it means the emulator can no longer accurately determine the uniquness of a hash or the graphics it is supposed to represent. However, there are certain situations that arise where such hash collisions are in fact very suitable. That part is described below when the theory begins to deal with color.</p>

				<p class="inner_text">Digressing, the hashing method itself can be anything an emulator chooses, from CRC32, MD5, SHA1, or even customized algorithms. As long as each of these methods can reliably avoid hash collisions, there is no restriction on what may be used in regards to <strong>CGFX</strong>. Customized algorithms, however, are probably best suited for an emulator due to the ability of the emulator to decide what sort of input data needs to be hashed. On that subject, any method used must always account for data that makes a certain tile unique from others. Such data typically includes the following:</p>

				<ul>
				<li>Dot Data - This is the &#34;raw&#34; pixel pattern of a tile, also known as the &#34;paletted pixel data&#34;</li>
				<li>Color Palette</li>
				<li>Tile Attributes - These can be entries that specify things like horizontal or vertical flipping, or other such effects</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="inner_text">The above is only an example, not an absolute standard. Different game consoles will need different sets of data, even some bits of information not described here. The dot data, however, is virtually guaranteed to be necessary in almost every instance. The dot data forms the bulk of a tile&#39;s uniqueness as it roughly specifies what exactly the tile should look like, even without applying the color palette or additonal attributes. How best to incorportate the above data is something that will vary between game consoles and their underlying graphical systems.</p>

				<p class="inner_text_large"><strong>Custom Graphics: Extracting and Editing Graphics</strong>

				<p class="inner_text">The next phase in <strong>CGFX</strong> is for the emulator to extract or &#34;dump&#34; specified graphics from the game, and then have them edit the tiles to their liking. On the surface, this is simple enough. Rather than drawing those tiles on-screen, they can be saved to a buffer; that buffer can then be converted and saved into an image file with the appropiate programming tools. However, there are a host of considerations emulator developers must take into account in terms of designing their UI. Indeed, a lot of effort may need to go into the interface to facilitate ease of use (or making it usable at all, depending on complexity).</p>

				<p class="inner_text">The easiest solution is to automatically dump all the graphics as the game generates them. While this works, the problem rests with overwhelming a user with hundreds or perhaps thousands of images. Some games use exceptionally small tile sizes; for example, the GB, GBC, and GBA all use 8x8 tiles for their backgrounds. A single level may contain dozens and dozens different tiles. If the emulator dumps them as it encounters each tile, the user will be flooded with tiny images that for the most part lack order. It would be a puzzle for users, and all the pieces are painfully pint-sized. A better option is to provide some way for users to select individual tiles from the current screen or from the current data in VRAM. A good interface should allow users to pick out specific graphics of their choice, especially when the game console support multiple layers</p>

				<p class="inner_text">In addition to being able to select and dump individual tiles at once, an emulator supporting
