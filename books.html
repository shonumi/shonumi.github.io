				<p class="inner_text">In addition to writing the <strong>Edge of Emulation</strong> articles, I also publish books about video games. Although hardware and software preservation is very important, it's equally crucial that we step back and examine the history behind games and consoles. Through research and analysis, authors can provide meaningful context and understanding for all of those blinking pixels of the past. Saving content is just one part of my job; making sense of everything is another. Today, we're finally seeing the growth of a new genre of books that explore the origins of gaming, look at the how the industry evolved, and try to fit all of these pieces together.</p>
